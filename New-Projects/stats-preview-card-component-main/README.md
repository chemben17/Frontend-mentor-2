## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to work an image in aflex and how undserelay actually affects image.
I learnt how to work flex items better, how it is important to set an height so as to be able to make them align vertically.\
I learn thow to make the items have equall width, regardless of the initialm size

### Continued development

One of the major issue I had was how to make the page responsive and that is what i intend to work on molre starting from now and how to use media queries as well.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped to use clamp for header
- [Example resource 2](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-image-overlays-css/) - This served as aguideline as to using overlay. T least i got a hint of what to do.
